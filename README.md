# shopeasy

A new Flutter project.

making shopping as seamless as possibleâ€”no waiting, no scanning, just grab and go shopping using NFC stickers to each product and integrating an NFC reader in shopping carts. Customers will scan a QR code via our app to link their cart, and every item added will be instantly updated on their phone. A "Pay Now" button will enable quick, hassle-free checkout. Our approach involves IoT integration, real-time database syncing, and a user-friendly mobile interface. We aim to create a frictionless shopping experience.
