# shopeasy

A new Flutter project.

Our project aims to revolutionize the retail shopping experience by eliminating checkout lines and manual scanning. Using NFC-enabled stickers on products and an NFC reader integrated into shopping carts, customers can seamlessly add items to their virtual cart in real time. Shoppers will scan a QR code via our mobile app to link their cart, ensuring that every item picked is instantly reflected on their device.

With IoT integration and real-time database syncing, the system provides a smooth and responsive shopping experience. A "Pay Now" button in the app allows for instant, hassle-free checkout, enabling customers to complete their purchase without delays. This project focuses on automation, seamless connectivity, and user-friendly design to create a truly frictionless shopping journey.
