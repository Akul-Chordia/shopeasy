# Shopeasy

## Overview

This Flutter-based project aims to revolutionize the retail shopping experience by eliminating checkout lines and manual scanning. Using **NFC-enabled stickers** on products and an **NFC reader** integrated into shopping carts, customers can seamlessly add items to their virtual cart in real time.

Shoppers scan a **QR code** via the mobile app to link their cart, ensuring that every item picked is instantly reflected on their device. With **IoT integration** and **real-time database syncing**, the system provides a smooth and responsive shopping experience. A **"Pay Now" button** in the app enables instant, hassle-free checkout, allowing customers to complete their purchases without delays.

## Features

- **NFC-Based Item Detection**: Each product has an NFC tag, allowing automatic addition to the cart.
- **QR Code Cart Linking**: Securely link the shopping cart with the customer's mobile app.
- **Real-Time Syncing**: Items are updated instantly in the app using cloud-based database technology.
- **Seamless Checkout**: Customers can pay directly through the app without waiting in line.
- **IoT Integration**: Shopping carts are equipped with NFC readers for automated item detection.
